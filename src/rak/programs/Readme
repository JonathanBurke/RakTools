README - rak.programs

rak.programs holds all of the command line programs in RakTools

Only scala Object definitions with main methods should appear in this directory.  In general these classes
should be wrappers that read options and call some other class/method to do the real work.

This approach has 3 benefits:
1) The program class has one specific task: handling program startup and shutdown.
2) This keeps any functionality from being tied to command line calls and allows it to be called from code.
3) Readability, mixing the above 2 cases always makes things harder to read.

Note, once built these programs can be called by invoking:
scripts/rak ProgramName

Where ProgramName is a classname from this package:
e.g.
rak.programs.SplitMavenArgs can be run via:

rak SplitMavenArgs <normal argument list>

The rak script is just a wrapper around a java call with the Rak jar on the classpath.  If appends the
qualified-package to the class name and runs that as the main class.
